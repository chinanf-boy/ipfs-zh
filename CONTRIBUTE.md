# Contributing to IPFS

There are many ways to contribute to IPFS development. We welcome contributions big and small! We also have more extensive [community contributing notes](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/contributing.md).

### Help with the design

If you have a suggestion regarding the overall design of IPFS (or if find an error), please submit an [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/new).

This repository is a landing repository for IPFS in general, and where any big updates will be posted. If you have an error with an [implementation](README.md#implementations), file an issue in the respective repository. If you have more questions about the abstracted design, you can also check [specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs).

### Help with the implementations

Please contribute to the various [implementations](README.md#implementations) under development, or start another!

There are also many other repositories that are part of IPFS, listed in the [project directory](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/project-directory.md). Dive in and help out.

### Help with spreading the word

Please tweet, email, tell everyone about this. IPFS will succeed only if many people use it and build on it.

### Help in other ways

[Email @jbenet directly](mailto:juan@ipfs.io?subject=Contributing to IPFS) if you'd like to help in other ways.
